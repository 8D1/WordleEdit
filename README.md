# WordleEdit
WordleEdit is a multiplayer version of Wordle (created by Josh Wardle) where players can edit their own words as they go. It runs as a Discord bot! I programmed the bot in February 2022 and played it with friends in March 2022, but for some reason I never released the source code until now. Well, here it is!
